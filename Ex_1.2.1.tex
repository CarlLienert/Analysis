\section{Exercise 1.2.1}
Suppose that $\sqrt{3}$ were rational.  Then $$\sqrt{3}=\frac{p}{q}$$ for some integers $p$ and $q$ which are relatively prime.

Then, we'd have $$3q^2=p^2.$$
There are an odd number of factors of 3 on the left hand side, and hence and odd number of factors of 3 on the right hand side.  But, this is impossible.
